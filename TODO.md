### Database
- Find anternative to planetscale (probably just local sqlite3, I don't want to depend on these dogshit services)

### Register (/auth/register)
- Probably not going to implement this as this project is just meant for me and I really don't want to deal with users

### Deploy
- Auto deploy to vps
- Figure out how to do this with github actions
